summary: Micropolis, the original city simulation game from Maxis Software
description: |
  Micropolis, the original award winning city simulation game from
  Maxis Software, now runs on powerful Unix workstations with X11!  Now
  it's souped up, and even supports networked multi user collaboration!
  Multi Player Micropolis is designed to be a fun cooperative educational
  experience!

  Micropolis is a colorful animated interactive system simulation
  game, providing a set of rules and tools for planning and building a
  complex dynamic simulated city.  Several people on different X11
  workstations can participate in the same city, cooperating and
  coordinating their actions across the network.

  Working together, you can zone land use, hook up the power grid,
  build roads, bridges, parks and stadiums, raise taxes, and even summon
  disasters, causing the city to grow and thrive, or crumble and die.  It's
  a creative, entertaining way to develop your political skills!
